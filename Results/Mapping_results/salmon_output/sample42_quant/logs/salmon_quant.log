[2020-08-07 16:40:41.049] [jointLog] [info] Counted 14,113,003 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-08-07 16:40:41.056] [jointLog] [warning] 0.178521% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
