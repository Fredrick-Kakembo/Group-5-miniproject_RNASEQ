[2020-08-07 16:38:13.462] [jointLog] [info] Counted 11,084,129 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-08-07 16:38:13.469] [jointLog] [warning] 0.142821% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
